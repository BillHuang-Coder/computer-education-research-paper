Programming has become an essential skill for STEM students
nowadays, and many students find it hard to get started. Personal
assistance is needed to help struggling students be better supported
in their programming learning process. Student performance prediction is an important step for personal assistance. Several prior
works have been trying to predict students’ coding performance
by analyzing their keystroke data in the coding process. However,
almost all of these works only focus on the prediction task of the
data of the same semester. It is obvious that this kind of work could
hardly be applied to practical applications as students’ scores are
unavailable until the semester ends. To fill the gap between existing works and practical applications, we use the data from the
same course but the previous semester to predict students’ scores in
the current semester. We apply the domain adaptation method like
TCA in the machine learning area to boost the model’s performance
on cross-semester prediction tasks. Our results suggest that the
domain adaptation method can help improve predicting students’
coding performance when only previous semester data is available
for training the model. However, our results suggest that even if
the domain adaptation method is applied, it is still a big problem
to predict students’ coding performance in practical application
situations.
